# AbacDsp
Dsp code for abacad projects

## Concept

To make the most compact dsp code most stuff is done with templates.

Furthermore, it uses a lot of float calculations instead of double as this is 
usually sufficient for good quality dsp code.

### Usage

For usage check always the unit-tests, they contain implementation examples 
which should be  self-explanatory.
